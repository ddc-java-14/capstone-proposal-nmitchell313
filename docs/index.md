## Client component

### Functionality

* User will be able to decide on picking a quote from a specific author, a daily generated quote or one quote at a time.

* User will be able to receive a quote and learn the author of that quote.

### Persistent data

* TBD

// (List the content that will be stored on the client side. This should include any information that a user of your 
//system should expect to be maintained locally (i.e. without connection to a server) across multiple sessions of use, 
//on a single device.)

## Server component

### Functionality

* TBD

// (List the key functional aspects that will be provided by the server component---i.e. tell us what parts of the 
// system functionality will be performed by the server.)

### Persistent data

*TBD

// (List the content that will be stored on the server side. This should include any information that a user of your 
// system should expect to be accessible across multiple sessions of use, even if accessed from separate devices. 
// In addition, if there will be data originating from some users that will then be accessible by other users, 
// it should be part of the persistent data on the server.) 
    
### External services

* TBD

// (If the server component will need to access already-existing external services 
// (e.g. stock prices, Open Movie Database), those should also be listed here. Any such references to external services 
// should include links to the main page or API description page for the service.)
    
## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

* TBD

// (If you can identify functional elements of the software that you think might not be achievable in the scope of
// the project, but which would nonetheless add significant value if you were able to include them, list them here. 
// For now, we recommend listing them in order of complexity/amount of work, from the least to the most.)
